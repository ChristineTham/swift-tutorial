# Getting Started with the Outlook Mail API and Swift #

The purpose of this guide is to walk through the process of creating a simple Swift app that retrieves messages in Office 365. The source code in this repository is what you should end up with if you follow the steps outlined here.

## Before you begin ##

This guide assumes:

- That you already have Xcode installed and working on your development machine.
- That you have an Office 365 tenant, with access to an account in that tenant.

## Create the app ##

Let's dive right in! Open Xcode, and on the **File** menu, choose **New** then **Project**. In the left-hand pane, choose **Application** under **iOS**, then choose **Single View Application**. Click **Next**.
